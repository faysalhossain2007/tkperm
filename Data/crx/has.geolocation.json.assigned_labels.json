By right clicking on the selected text the context menu opens and you can click on \"Send address to Google Maps\". \n\nA new tab will be opened and automatically search for the address on Google Maps.\n\nAnd if you need directions:\nJust go to the options page and enter up to five favorite addresses.

You can now set the default travel mode to either driving, waking, bicycling or public transport.\n- Added options for context menu customization. You can now remove all sub menus for faster access to \"Show on Maps\" or just add the sub menus you require. Unfortunately, Google Chrome Extensions don't allow to place multiple context menus entries on the top level of the context menu. Based on all your feedback I added this option to reduce the depth of the context menu.\n- Fixed broken address auto completation on options page.\n- Added internal usage statistics for further feature optimizations.\n\nUpdate 3.7:\n======================================\n- Added shortcut support. Press Ctrl+1 (on Mac Cmd+1) to directly open Google Maps with the current text selection.\n- If you have entered favorite addresses, you can use Ctrl+Shift+1 (on Mac Cmd+Shift+1) to open Google Maps with directions from selected Text to first address.
