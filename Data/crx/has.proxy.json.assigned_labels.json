    "description": "The easy to use Cloud VPN means unlimited traffic at high speedBefore reading about the CloudVPN application, please answer several questions:\n\n- Do you need anonymity when surfing on the Internet?\n- Do you want your personal data to be protected?\n- Have you ever got access to blocked web resources?\n- Do you use public Wi-Fi access points?\n\nAnd now say how many affirmative answers you have got. If less than two, you do not need this utility and you may stop reading here. As for all the rest, the information below is for you.\n\nNow let\u2019s discuss every question. How can the CloudVPN utility provide anonymity? No problems at all!\n- You connect to one of 92 servers that are located in 34 countries of the world,\n- You go to the global network under entirely different IP address, and\n- Crawlers and programs that monitor the activity of visitors register you as a user from the country where the server is located.\n\nThus, your real IP is masked and is not accessible by anyone. Besides, CloudVPN servers do not register connection logs. Never. At all. It is impossible to monitor the service user.\n\nThe next question is about the data protection. The connection channel of the user\u2019s device to the server is coded by using the AES-256 algorithm. Not to talk too much about its reliability, it is enough to say that this is the main protocol of the cryptographic protection used by special services from various countries.\n\nProblem three is related to blocking web resources. It is easy to solve it. You merely should change your IP. That\u2019s all. The CloudVPN does it in two clicks, and as many times per session as you want. In this case the service acts as a protected proxy server.\n\n\nDo not worry about public Wi-Fi access points. They are not connected as usual. The CloudVPN application creates its own protected channel that cannot be cracked. All data is transferred exclusively within it.\n\nThose users who need more than one coded channel can get DoubleVPN protection. This is how it works. The user\u2019s device connects to one of the servers. Then one more protected tunnel is created between this server and another one selected by the user. Thus, there is double cryptographic protection of transferred data. Great, isn\u2019t it?\n\nAnd now let\u2019s talk about something pleasant. The service provides every user with one day free testing of the CloudVPN application in the toughest mode.\n\nPrices for the services are minimal. The speed of downloading pages and files is the highest and depends only on your Internet channel capacity. The traffic is unlimited.\n\nAnd the main thing is that you can use one login on five additional devices. You can connect your relatives or friends without increasing the price.\n\nDownload and use it!",

We guarantee full access to the popular torrent tracker without extra costs, sms and unnecessary software. Get access to Rutraker for free, Rutracker without ads.\n\nWhy is Rutracker blocked and he stopped working?\nThe site is blocked at the request of the rightholders and the decision of the Moscow City Court (the suit of the publishing house \"Exmo\" is satisfied). Rutracker (RUTRACKER) is blocked for Russian users \"forever\" using the recently introduced procedure in the Russian legislation \"lifelong blocking sites.\"\n\nHow to enter Rutraker, and continue using it in your usual mode?\nVery simple!

Addionally you can use our proxy service to circumvent the geo-restrictions of several supported sites. In case your site is not supported you can select a country and the whole browser traffic will be routed via our proxy.\n\nTo use this extension you need a valid premium account on Premiumize.me.
